# README

This repository contains a project that uses transfer learning to classify brain images into those that have tumors and those that do not.

There is a single Jupyter notebook  called `article.ipynb` containing the code needed to reproduce the project in conjunction with a requirements.txt file.

Additionally, the repository contains the hand-sorted data needed for the project in the `./data` directory. It contains folders `train`, `test` and `validate`, each of which have subdirectories named `yes` and `no`. The `yes` folders contain images of brain scans that a doctor has determined to contain a tumor. The `no` folder contains images determined to be without tumors. See [Guillaume Fradet's GitHub repository](https://github.com/guillaumefrd/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) for the original data.

Lastly, the notebook has been converted into markdown and PDF format for ease of reading and portability.
